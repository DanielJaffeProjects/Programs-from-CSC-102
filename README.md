# Programs from CSC-102

Welcome to the **Programs from CSC-102** repository! This collection showcases a variety of Python programs developed during my **Computer Science 102** course, where I explored advanced programming concepts and techniques.

## üìö Course Overview

CSC-102 builds upon foundational programming knowledge, focusing on:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Inheritance, and abstract classes.
- **Practical Applications:** Applying programming concepts to real-world scenarios.

These projects emphasize creative problem-solving, efficient coding practices, and software design principles.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- **Program 1:** Gymnastics Score Calculator
- **Program 2:** Emulating Circuits
- **Program 3:** Bears and Fish Simulation
- **scores.csv:** Sample data for Program 1.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Skills

This repository demonstrates proficiency in:

- **Python:** The primary programming language used.
- **File Handling:** Reading and writing data for processing.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Using inheritance and abstract classes.

## üìà Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I:

- Strengthened my understanding of programming concepts and their real-world applications.
- Improved my ability to design and implement efficient solutions.
- Gained hands-on experience with advanced Python programming techniques.
